/**
 * StreamProcessingOptions
 * @typedef {Object} StreamProcessingOptions - stream processing options which configure ONLY the property (i.e.
 * non-function) settings of an AWS stream consumer and are a subset of the full StreamProcessingSettings
 * @property {string} streamType - the type of stream being processed - valid values are "kinesis" or "dynamodb"
 * @property {boolean|undefined} [sequencingRequired] - whether sequencing is required or not (defaults to true if not specified)
 * @property {boolean|undefined} [sequencingPerKey] - whether message sequencing is per key or not (i.e. per shard) - see notes below for more detail
 * @property {boolean|undefined} [batchKeyedOnEventID] - whether each batch must be keyed on its first usable record's event ID (if DynamoDB or true) or on its shard ID (if Kinesis and false)
 * @property {boolean|undefined} [kplEncoded] - whether the incoming records are Kinesis Producer Library (KPL) encoded records (with or without Aggregation) or not (defaults to false if not specified)
 * @property {string|undefined} [consumerIdSuffix] - an optional suffix to append to the derived consumer ID of the stream consumer (ONLY used if consumerId is NOT explicitly configured)

 * @property {number} timeoutAtPercentageOfRemainingTime - the percentage of the remaining time at which to timeout processing (expressed as a number between 0.0 and 1.0, e.g. 0.9 would mean timeout at 90% of the remaining time)
 * @property {number} maxNumberOfAttempts - the maximum number of attempts on each of a message's tasks that are allowed before discarding the message and routing it to the Dead Message Queue. Note that if a message has multiple tasks, it will only be discarded when all of its tasks have reached this maximum
 * @property {string[]} idPropertyNames - the names of all of the identifier properties of a message, which are used to extract a message's unique identifier(s), which uniquely identifies the message.
 * @property {string[]} keyPropertyNames - the names of all of the key properties of a message, which are used to extract a message's key(s), which uniquely identify the entity or subject of a message
 * @property {string[]} seqNoPropertyNames - the names of all of the sequence properties of a message, which are used to extract a message's sequence number(s), which determine the order in which messages with identical keys must be processed
 * @property {string} batchStateTableName - the unqualified name of the stream consumer batch state table from which to load and/or to which to save the state of the batch being processed
 * @property {string} deadRecordQueueName - the unqualified stream name of the Dead Record Queue to which to discard unusable records
 * @property {string} deadMessageQueueName - the unqualified stream name of the Dead Message Queue to which to discard rejected messages
 * @property {boolean|undefined} [avoidEsmCache] - whether to avoid using the event source mapping cache or not
 *
 * Notes:
 * 1. Setting `sequencingPerKey` to true means that messages with distinct keys will be sequenced separately, which will
 *    allow them to be processed in parallel from a shard and which will ONLY preserve sequence between messages with
 *    identical keys.
 * 2. Setting `sequencingPerKey` to false means that all messages will be sequenced together, which will ignore keys and
 *    force sequential processing of all messages from a shard in sequence number order.
 *
 * NB: The consumer ID acts as a subscription ID and MUST be unique amongst multiple different stream consumers that are
 * all consuming off of the same Kinesis or DynamoDB stream! The consumer ID defaults to a concatenation of the Lambda's
 * function name and its alias (if any) if NOT configured, which will meet the uniqueness requirement for all cases
 * except for the bizarre and most likely erroneous case of registering more than one event source mapping between the
 * SAME Lambda and the SAME Kinesis or DynamoDB stream, which in itself would cause duplicate delivery of all messages!
 * If the bizarre case really needs to be supported then EITHER use the consumerIdSuffix OR configure the two consumer
 * IDs explicitly to differentiate the two.
 *
 * NB: For Kinesis stream consumer configuration:
 * 1. idPropertyNames - Optional, but RECOMMENDED - otherwise ids are derived from a concatenation of derived keys and seqNos if not specified
 * 2. keyPropertyNames - MANDATORY if sequencing is required; otherwise OPTIONAL, but RECOMMENDED anyway to assist with identification & discarding to DMQ
 * 3. seqNoPropertyNames - Optional, but RECOMMENDED - otherwise seqNos are derived from kinesis.sequenceNumber if not specified
 *
 * NB: For DynamoDB stream consumer configuration:
 * 1. idPropertyNames - Optional, but RECOMMENDED - otherwise ids are derived from a concatenation of derived keys and seqNos if not specified
 * 2. keyPropertyNames - Optional, but NOT recommended - since keys are derived from dynamodb.Keys if NOT specified
 * 3. seqNoPropertyNames - Optional, but NOT recommended - since seqNos are derived from dynamodb.SequenceNumber if NOT specified
